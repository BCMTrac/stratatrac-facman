  timeIntervalMinutes: number;
  defaultDurationMinutes: number;
  minDurationMinutes: number;
  maxDurationMinutes: number;
  operatingHours: {
    start: string;
    end: string;
  };

}
```

### State Management
```typescript
// Update time settings for a facility
updateFacilityTimeSettings(categoryId, facilityId, settings);

// Access settings
const facility = facilities[categoryId].facilities.find(f => f.id === facilityId);
const settings = facility?.timeSettings;
```

### Helper Functions Available
```typescript
// Generate available time slots
const slots = generateTimeSlots(facility, selectedDate);

// Validate duration
const { valid, message } = validateBookingDuration(facility, 90);

// Check if date is bookable
const { bookable } = isDateBookable(facility, futureDate);

// Get default duration
const defaultDuration = getDefaultDuration(facility);
```
