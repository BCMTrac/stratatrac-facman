## Tips & Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do's

- Set min duration equal to interval for better scheduling
- Allow multiple slots for facilities used for events
- Limit advance booking (7-14 days) for frequently used items
- Test bookings after changing settings

### ‚ùå Don'ts
- Don't make min > max duration
- Don't set start time after end time
- Don't make intervals too short (<15 min) unless necessary
- Don't allow multiple slots for gym equipment (causes hogging)
- Don't set advance booking too far (>60 days) unless needed
