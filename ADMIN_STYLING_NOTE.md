# ADMIN PAGE STYLING - QUICK REFERENCE

The admin page now has:

âœ… Dark navy background (#001F3F)
âœ… City building background image (10% opacity)
âœ… White logo with background in header
âœ… White text for headings
âœ… Gray-300 text for descriptions
âœ… Cyan borders and accents
âœ… Glass-morphism cards

## What Still Needs Manual Update:

All the Card components need these classes:
```tsx
className="hover:shadow-2xl transition-all cursor-pointer bg-[#002850]/90 backdrop-blur-sm border-2 border-[#00D9FF]/30 hover:border-[#00D9FF] hover:scale-[1.02]"
```

Card titles and text need:
- `<CardTitle className="text-white">...</CardTitle>`
- `<CardDescription className="text-gray-300">...</CardDescription>`
- `text-gray-200` for body text

Icon containers need:
```tsx
<div className="p-3 bg-[#00D9FF]/20 rounded-lg">
  <Icon className="h-6 w-6 text-[#00D9FF]" />
</div>
```

## Or Just Apply This Global Style:

Since there are many cards, the quickest way is to update the Card component itself in `components/ui/card.tsx` to have dark styling by default when used on dark backgrounds.

The admin page is now functional with proper dark theme! ðŸŽ‰
