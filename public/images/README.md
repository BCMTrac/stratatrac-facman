# BACKGROUND IMAGE SETUP

## Option 1: Use Your Own High-Quality Image (RECOMMENDED)

1. Save the clear pool/building image you have
2. Name it: `building-pool-bg.jpg`
3. Place it in: `C:\bcmtracdev\facman\public\images\building-pool-bg.jpg`

## Option 2: Use Multiple High-Quality Images

Save these images to `public/images/`:
- `building-pool-bg.jpg` - Main login background
- `building-hero.jpg` - Dashboard background
- `pool-twilight.jpg` - Alternative background

## Current Issue

Unsplash compresses images, causing blur. Solution: Use your own high-res images!

## After Adding Image

The code will automatically use `/images/building-pool-bg.jpg` from the public folder.
