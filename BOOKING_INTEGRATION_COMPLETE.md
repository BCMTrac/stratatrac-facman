# Booking Form Integration - COMPLETE âœ…

## What Changed

The booking form now **dynamically uses the time settings** configured for each facility!

### Key Updates to `BookingFormModal.tsx`

1. **Dynamic Time Slots**
   - Time slots are now generated based on facility's `timeIntervalMinutes`
   - Uses facility's `operatingHours` (start/end times)
   - Falls back to default 30-min slots (7am-10pm) if no settings configured

2. **Dynamic Durations**
   - Duration options generated based on `minDurationMinutes` and `maxDurationMinutes`
   - Pre-selects the `defaultDurationMinutes` when form opens
   - Shows min/max duration info under the dropdown

3. **Advance Booking Limit**
   - Calendar now respects `advanceBookingDays` setting
   - Users can't select dates beyond the configured advance booking period
   - Default is 30 days if not configured

4. **Visual Indicators**
   - Shows facility time settings at top of form: "7:00-22:00 â€¢ 30 min slots â€¢ Book up to 30 days ahead"
   - Duration field shows min/max constraints
   - Better user feedback on what's allowed

### Example Behavior

#### Facility WITH Time Settings (e.g., Tennis Court)
```
Settings: 
- Time Interval: 60 minutes
- Operating Hours: 06:00 - 21:00
- Min Duration: 60 min
- Max Duration: 120 min
- Advance Booking: 14 days

Result:
- Time slots: 06:00, 07:00, 08:00, ..., 20:00
- Duration options: 1 hour, 2 hours
- Can book up to 14 days ahead
```

#### Facility WITHOUT Time Settings (Default)
```
Result:
- Time slots: 07:00, 07:30, 08:00, ..., 21:30
- Duration options: 30min, 1hr, 1.5hrs, 2hrs, 3hrs, 4hrs
- Can book up to 30 days ahead
```

## How It Works

1. When booking modal opens, it finds the current facility object
2. Extracts time settings (if configured)
3. Generates dynamic time slots using `generateTimeSlots()`
4. Generates duration options using `generateDurationOptions()`
5. Sets max booking date based on `advanceBookingDays`
6. Displays settings info and enforces constraints

## Test It!

1. Start app: `npm run dev`
2. Login as admin (bcmtrac/miduser)
3. Configure time settings for a facility (e.g., Tennis Court 1)
4. Select that facility and click "Make Booking"
5. Notice the time slots and durations match your settings! âœ¨

## Functions Added

- `generateTimeSlots(facility)` - Creates time slot array
- `generateDurationOptions(facility)` - Creates duration options
- `formatDuration(minutes)` - Formats minutes to readable string

## Validation

The form now enforces:
- âœ… Can't book dates in the past
- âœ… Can't book beyond advance booking period
- âœ… Only shows time slots within operating hours
- âœ… Only shows allowed duration ranges
- âœ… Pre-fills default duration

Ready to use! ðŸš€
