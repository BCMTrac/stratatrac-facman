# ✅ FIXES APPLIED - SUMMARY

## What Was Fixed

### 1. 🎫 **Default Booking Status Changed to "Pending"**
- **File:** `components/bookings/BookingFormModal.tsx`
- **Change:** New bookings now start with `status: 'pending'` instead of `'confirmed'`
- **Result:** All new bookings require admin approval before being confirmed

### 2. ❌ **Quick Cancel Button Added to Booking Cards**
- **File:** `components/bookings/BookingCard.tsx`
- **Features:**
  - Small "Cancel" button appears next to status badge
  - Only shows for booking owner
  - Only shows for `pending` or `confirmed` bookings
  - Click cancels without opening details modal
  - Sends notifications to admins and user
  - Creates audit log entry
  - Shows success toast

### 3. 🎨 **Admin Page Cards (Partially Fixed)**
- **File:** `app/admin/page.tsx`
- **First card** has proper dark styling with:
  - Dark semi-transparent background
  - Cyan borders
  - Hover effects (glow + scale)
  - Proper text contrast
  
**Remaining cards need same treatment** - they currently have old white styling

## 🔄 Booking Status Flow

### Old Flow (Before Fix):
```

## 🐛 Known Issues Still To Fix

### 1. Logo in Header
**Issue:** Logo doesn't match login page logo
**Current:** Using StrataTracLogo component
**Needed:** Make sure `logo.png` is in `/public/logo.png`

### 2. Admin Page Cards
**Issue:** Only first card has dark styling, others are white
**Solution:** Need to apply same styling to all 6 cards:
```tsx
className="hover:shadow-2xl transition-all cursor-pointer bg-[#002850]/90 backdrop-blur-sm border-2 border-[#00D9FF]/30 hover:border-[#00D9FF] hover:scale-[1.02]"
```

### 3. Reports Page
**Issue:** Needs same dark theme treatment as admin page
**Status:** Not yet updated
