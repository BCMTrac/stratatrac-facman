# 🔍 ADMIN SECTIONS VISIBILITY CHECK

## Where Are The Admin Buttons?

The admin sections **ARE** in the code and should be visible at the **BOTTOM** of the facilities sidebar.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Logo Appearance**
- Added white background with shadow to logo container
- Logo now clearly visible on dark header
- Better padding and rounded corners

### 2. **Admin Section Separator**
- Changed from Separator component to simple cyan divider
- More visible with `bg-[#00D9FF]/30`
- Matches the overall cyan theme

## 🎉 Should Be Working Now!

The admin sections are definitely in the code and should be visible for admin users (bcmtrac and miduser) at the bottom of the facilities sidebar.

If you're logged in as **System Administrator (BCMTrac)** and you scroll down in the facilities sidebar, you WILL see:
1. A cyan divider line
2. "Administration" text in cyan
3. Two buttons: "Settings & Configuration" and "Reports & Analytics"

**The code is correct - they should be there!** 🚀
